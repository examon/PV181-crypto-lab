Hashing (use "dgst -help" for help on hashing)
1. Check the correctness of implementation of sha1 from openssl. 
2. How hash is changed for 1 bit change of message? Check!
3. Compute sha1 hash of shattered-1.pdf and shattered-2.pdf. Open both files and see differences.
4. Download the libcrypt from the page http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/general/libgcrypt.html and check the hash.


AES encrypt/decrypt (use "enc -help" for help on encryption)
5. Generate random key K for AES-128 to key.bin file (command rand).
6. Transform key K to base64. 
7. Use key and encrypt file.txt of many 11111111.... (create) to file.ecb using ecb mode. Do you see any pattern?
8. Print file file.ecb to base64. Do you see any pattern?
9. Repeat 6. with cbc mode. Do you see any pattern?


RSA  
1. Generate RSA public key.
2. Generate corresponding private key.
