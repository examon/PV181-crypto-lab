1. Generate RSA-2048 key for root CA.  [2]
2. Generate sub-ordinate CA signed by CA. [2]
3. Write simple program in C programming language and generate random key K.bin for AES 128. [3]
4. Encrypt file file.txt "yourUCO" using K.bin to encrypted.bin using arbitrary symmetric cipher.
   Use my certificate SYS.crt and encrypt key K to encryptedK.bin for me (I should be able to decrypt file). [3]

Describe entire process, commands you used in Desc_xxxx.txt (xxxx stands
for your UCO). Archive all required files (so it can be opened in Windows 
10 without installation of additional SW) and submit it as a single file into
IS.
